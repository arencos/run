### Why use run?
You can easily run multiple commands in a single line, and for some applications like dmenu or rofi, it allows you to run multiple apps at once!

### How does it work?
Run is very easy to use. Lets say I wanted to execute pcmanfm and Sublime Text. I would need to type *run pcmanfm subl*! If you need to add arguments to a command, you need to add " in the beginning and the end. Like *run "pcmanfm /home/aren/Documents" subl*!

### How do I install it?
If you want to use run from everywhere in your system and application launchers, you need to run *./install*. If you want to use it locally, just type *./run*!

### Can I see a video of how it works?
Yes, you can! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyJuMro3w6I
